      "answer1": "No additional licence is required to tow a Teardrop with a GVWR between 500 and 750 kg. However, make sure the combined GVWR of the caravan and towing vehicle does not exceed 3,500 kg, otherwise a specific B96 training will be required.",
      "question2": "Can the Teardrop be towed by any vehicle?",
      "answer2": "Thanks to its low weight, the Teardrop can be towed by most cars. To be sure, refer to your vehicle manufacturer's data or check your registration certificate: subtract line F2 from line F3; the result must be greater than or equal to 500 kg.",
      "question3": "Do you provide after-sales service?",
      "answer3": "Yes, our caravans are guaranteed for 2 years. We also offer personalised support for any repairs, modifications or technical questions after purchase.",

      "answer5": "The average lead time is two months, but it may be longer depending on current orders.",
      "question6": "Are the mini-caravans suitable for all seasons?",
      "answer6": "The Teardrop is designed to offer optimum comfort in all seasons. Although its outdoor kitchen is more pleasant to use in fine weather, its insulation guarantees comfortable nights.",

      "question2": "Can I have it delivered?",
      "answer2": "Yes, delivery is possible. Contact us to find out the terms according to your location.",
      "question3": "Where can I sleep with it?",
      "answer3": "The camper can be used wherever bivouacking is allowed. Check local regulations: in general, you can set up in nature for one night as long as you respect the environment.",
      "question4": "Do you provide after-sales service?",
      "answer4": "Yes, all our campers are guaranteed for 2 years. We also provide follow-up if needed.",
      "question5": "What is the manufacturing lead time?",
      "answer5": "The timeframe varies depending on the season and the level of customisation desired. Generally count between 2 and 6 weeks. Contact us for a more precise estimate.",
      "question6": "Is it possible to use this camper with a non-electric bike?",
      "answer6": "Yes, it is designed to be towed by a standard bike. However, for long distances or hilly terrain, an electric bike can improve comfort.",
      "question7": "Are bike campers suitable for all seasons?",
      "answer7": "In winter they provide effective protection from the cold, but in extreme temperatures appropriate equipment (sleeping bag, duvet) may be necessary for optimal comfort. In summer, the openings allow good air circulation to keep you cool."
