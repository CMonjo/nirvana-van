      "question1": "Do I need a special license to tow a Teardrop?",
      "answer1": "No additional license is required to tow a Teardrop with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) between 500 and 750 kg. Just make sure the combined GVW of the trailer and your car does not exceed 3,500 kg — otherwise, you’ll need a B96 endorsement.",
      "question2": "Can a Teardrop be towed by any vehicle?",
      "answer2": "Thanks to its light weight, the Teardrop can be towed by most cars. To be sure, check your car’s technical specifications or your registration certificate: subtract line F2 from F3 — the result should be 500 kg or more.",
      "question3": "Do you offer after-sales service?",
      "answer3": "Yes, our caravans come with a 2-year warranty. We also offer personalized support for any repairs, upgrades, or technical questions after purchase.",
      "question4": "Can I visit your workshop?",
      "answer4": "Absolutely! We’d be delighted to welcome you. Just book a visit using our contact form.",
      "question5": "What is the production time?",
      "answer5": "On average, it takes about two months to build your Teardrop, though this may vary depending on current orders.",
      "question6": "Are Teardrops suitable for all seasons?",
      "answer6": "Yes — our Teardrops are built for comfort year-round. While the outdoor kitchen is best enjoyed in good weather, the insulated cabin ensures cozy nights in any season.",
      "question7": "Is it possible to try a teardrop before buying?",
      "answer7": "Yes, we offer visits and test drives at our workshop in Montpellier. Contact us to arrange an appointment!"

    "bike-camper": {
      "question1": "Can I attach the caravan to any bike?",

      "question2": "Can it be delivered to me?",
      "answer2": "Yes, delivery is available. Just get in touch with us to check the options for your location.",
      "question3": "Where am I allowed to sleep with it?",
      "answer3": "You can use the caravan wherever wild camping is permitted. Always check local regulations – in many places, one-night stays in nature are allowed as long as you respect the environment.",
      "question4": "Do you offer after-sales service?",
      "answer4": "Absolutely! All our caravans come with a 2-year warranty, and we’re here to help if you need support or repairs.",
      "question5": "How long does it take to build?",
      "answer5": "Lead times vary depending on the season and customization level. On average, allow 2 to 6 weeks. Contact us for a more precise estimate.",
      "question6": "Can I use the caravan with a non-electric bike?",
      "answer6": "Yes! It’s light enough to tow with a regular bike. For hilly terrain or longer trips, an electric bike can add extra comfort.",
      "question7": "Are the caravans suitable for all seasons?",
      "answer7": "Yes – they offer great protection in the cold. For extreme weather, just bring the right gear (like a good sleeping bag or warm duvet). In summer, the design ensures good airflow to keep things cool."
